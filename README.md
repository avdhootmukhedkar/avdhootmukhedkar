## Hi 👋 I’m Avdhoot Mukhedkar

Backend & Platform Engineer with a strong foundation in Data Science and ML-driven systems.  
I design and build **scalable backend platforms, high-throughput APIs, and cloud-native systems**, with a strong focus on correctness, performance, and long-term maintainability.

Over the years, I have worked extensively on:
- Backend systems for fintech, analytics, and SaaS platforms
- Subscription, billing, and account lifecycle automation
- Asynchronous processing and event-driven architectures
- ML-powered backend services deployed in production

I enjoy working on technically complex problems where architecture and execution matter.
